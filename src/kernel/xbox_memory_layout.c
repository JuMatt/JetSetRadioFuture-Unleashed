 * 1. VirtualAlloc a contiguous region at XBOX_BASE_ADDRESS
 * 2. Copy .rdata and initialized .data from the XBE
 * 3. Zero-fill the BSS region
 * 4. Set memory protection (read-only for .rdata)

/* The vertical-blank interrupt, acknowledged the way the hardware does.

 * times a second: it sets PCRTC_INTR_0's VBLANK bit and PMC_INTR_0's PCRTC
 * bit, then calls the title's interrupt service routine, which queues a DPC
 * and returns. The DPC -- running later, on the timer thread -- reads
 * PMC_INTR_0 to find out which unit interrupted, and only then signals the
 * device's vertical-blank event.
 *
 * Between those two steps sat this thread, wiping both registers to zero
 * every 200 us. So the DPC ran fifty-nine times a second and found nothing
 * pending fifty-seven of them. D3DDevice_BlockUntilVerticalBlank, which waits
 * on that event with no timeout, returned one to three times a second, and
 * the two threads parked in it -- one of them CRI's ADX server -- ran at that
 * rate too. A music stream that must be refilled thirty-eight times a second
 * was refilled twice, which is why the title's own decoder produced correct
 * audio in the wrong order.
 *
 * Both registers are write-1-to-clear on hardware and plain RAM here, so the
 * title's acknowledging write cannot be seen as a clear. It can be seen as a
 * write: it stores the register whole, as 1, so the marker bit the raise sets
 * is gone afterwards. Pending while the marker is there, acknowledged when it
 * is not -- and the acknowledgement de-asserts PMC_INTR_0's PCRTC bit, which
 * is what the handler's own spin loop is waiting for.
